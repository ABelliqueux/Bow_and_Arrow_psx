# Bow & Arrow PSX

Base on the original dos game by John Di Troia, From Bow and Arrow - In Search of the Greatest Archer v1.0 (1992)
https://www.classicdosgames.com/company/johnditroia.html

**WARNING : The following code is *TERRIBLE*, I am learning C, thus the terrible quality. But it does the job ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ and I had FUN**

Graphics are homemade with the awesome [Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/) software.

# Compiling

This project uses [Nugget+PsyQ](https://github.com/ABelliqueux/nolibgs_hello_worlds#setting-up-the-sdk--modern-gcc--psyq-aka-nuggetpsyq).

Git clone the project in the pcsx-redux folder : `(...)/pcsx-redux/src/mips/`,then in a terminal, just type `make` to build the ps-exe.
